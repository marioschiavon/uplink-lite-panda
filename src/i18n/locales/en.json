      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to set up the WhatsApp API?",
        "answer": "UplinkLite setup takes less than 5 minutes. The process is: create an account, scan the QR Code with WhatsApp, and start sending messages. No approval, business documentation, or complex integration required."

        "answer": "Yes. The UplinkLite WhatsApp API offers native integration with major automation tools: Make (Integromat), Zapier, n8n, and TypeBot. The API can also be integrated with any system via HTTP REST requests, including Python, Node.js, and PHP."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a message limit on the WhatsApp API?",
        "answer": "There's no message limit on the UplinkLite plan. For $15/month, you can send as many messages as you need to your customers, with no additional volume charges."
